	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I self-study and attend College of San Mateo. I run a tech shop out of the Bay Area, fixing this or that. These services help fund my way through college, as I'm trying to get my bachelors in Computer Science. I work in the meat department, but computers are my passion. I'm interested in Console modding, programming, ribeyes, and reading.</p>
